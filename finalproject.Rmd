## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("/cloud/project/kiva_loans.csv")
dat_mpi <- read.csv("/cloud/project/kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv")

dat_merged <- merge(dat,dat_mpi,by=c("country","region"))
final_dat <- dat_merged[order(dat_merged$MPI),]

str(dat)
summary(dat)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
